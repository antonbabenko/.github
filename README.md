# .github - a hidden gem in repository management

All github meta files are stored here and automatically linked from all repositories in [@antonbabenko account](https://github.com/antonbabenko).

## Why?

I learned about `.github` repository during GitHub Satellite 2019 in Berlin. I have been thinking about ways to reduce copy-pasting between similar repositories for several years.
